incorrectly glad retract anyone miffed the article makes four main points absence critical clauses in case idea licence is invalid t specify under country law gpl governed specification english only that end user opposed businesses the gpl t apply written in french arbitary licence change the point french law author change terms licence arbitarily granting rights author must clearly delimited in terms long dates times absence limitations original author right change software back closed whim david neary makes point copyright holder automatically retains right change the licence scott replies simply requires authorisation all copyright holders that understanding french law allows gpl type licence on condition specific conditions granting such rights clear is nothing stop original author taking back work lawyers see this correctly imho weakness gpl hidden defects roughly clause means author is are liable defects consumer is engineer linux blows and data lost authors liable ciaran johnson says oft others similar clauses point are all invalid one affects gpl also niall broinn makes point not sale rather service leasing arrangement and n come point i would suggest whole thrust this article see software sales even if money changes hands governed very much consumer law france anyway rick moen makes point not sale rather granting rights which are default see bit even granting rights author explicitly specified french law the fact two ip lawyers france think that the gpl covered sale make feel there de facto sale de facto contract roughly there may reasons french law gpl may invalid whole article freedom worth imperfect licences specialised lawyers look gpl lawyer cyril rojinsky duly appointed the court jurist vincent grynbaum specialised area intellectual property examine free licences particular gpl published study in review proprietes intellectuelles intellectual property their conclusion grim their approach interesting problem them know whether freedom valid french law question moot point but rather asked form and content text free licences in particular gpl problem free programmes rather licence contracts free programmes absence critical clauses the authors tell us first reference copyright legally sufficient framework international contracts case licence contracts programmes developed spread via internet idea copyright basically include differences one country to another international contracts necessary specify laws one referring french law american c the authors found three public licences which correctly formulated point qpl ibm public licence mozilla public licence specification english language next authors remind us least france clause contract may contrary to french law 2 however turns licence gpl contrary french law in several respects firstly written english fsf t officially approve translations the toubon law obliges sort of contract written french including businesses since notion user applies only consumers also businesses professionals c contacted editors linuxfrench lawyer cyril rojinsky declared far business concerned toubon law probably doomed change since it contradiction european directives on subject whatever problem still valid individuals while waiting french law change french companies deal since it law land programme gpl suddenly change licence another problem much serious that according french law author free programme time invoke the invalidity licence software simply changing licence in effect law intellectual property stipulates granting rights author subordinate the condition granted rights object distinct clause in granting act i licence that granting rights delimited respect scope grantees also respect location i rights may excersised duration grants case gpl of other free licences briefly means that france elsewhere author is french gpl could revert proprietary one day next the problem guarantee hidden defects an serious flaw guarantee gpl licences others show that software delivered without guarantee going immediately reply commercical programmes carry same clause licence contracts and correct however whatever written licence contract one free oneself guarantee hidden defects since imposed civil code concept poorly understood by layman protects buyer whoever may individual business since specifies civil code consumer protection law hidden defects deliberate made good faith the seller for example one buys pair socks in sale shop notice specifying sale items neither refunded exchanged arriving home notice one socks hole several scenarios possible you could checked socks purchase flaw deemed obvious and you sing money you could t check socks packaged example case despite notice neither refund exchange may invoke hidden defect and changed obtain refund it personally already invoked shops the hidden defect clause always worked well shopkeepers always cooperative quote couple words of civil code the concept hidden defect rather wide necessary t the possibility discovering defect before buying product according civil code would t bought price you known the defect the third case much rarer if able show vendor had knowledge defect hidden t inform case have reimburse product expenses incurred sale metro tickets go shop fuse which blew plugged c this idea hidden defect applies to products including programmes was made abundantly clear authorities courts surrounding y2k this particularly inconvenient free programmes since site offers linux distro download supposed provide guarantee hidden flaws linuxfrench asked cyril rojinsky in case free programme one could speak hidden defect since source code available he replied actually concerning guarantee question obvious defect arise analyis be different depending whether person downloads distribution is professional opensource advantage the proprietary programme protects the distributor guarantee of hidden defect insofar buy it person distribution public large problem remains the same roughly speaking lawyer cyril rojinsky said this study far exhaustive and many areas could explored during interview asked for example fragility gpl clause forbids linking source code gpl proprietary code in effect laws intellectual property give right user to modify programme the intention permitting interoperability with another programme i need link proprietary library communication protocol device driver may consider null void clause gpl the conclusion study wake up call community freedom merits shoddy licences which modified court cases proliferate put risk undeniable originality this effort 1 une publication de institut de recherche en proprit intellectuelle no4 juillet 2002 une telle clause de contrat qui est oppose ce que dit la loi franaise est

vendors released patch procedure often left hundreds thousands computers vulnerable known bugs months years vendors worked features often even patches released people would t apply t know serious problem was underground computer criminal community would often discover and exploit holes months years responsible disclosure process kept victims connections the underground vulnerable problem vulnerabilities widely known much less dangerous victims take steps to reduce potential impact including disabling software turning vulnerable features filtering traffic transit and detecting responding intrusions therefore much less useful would be intruders also software companies usually see security vulnerabilities software pr problems so prefer delay publication expense fixing bugs as

soviet union sphere influence which the united states maintained cold war first major foreign policy speech delivered november 1999 bush declared president must clear eyed realist formulation seems to connote absence world remaking ambition realism exactly the foreign policy doctrine cheney pentagon team rejected partly because posits impossibility one country ever dominating world affairs length time one gets many reminders washington days much terrorist attacks september 11th changed official foreign policy thinking any chief executive either party would probably done bush has done far made war taliban al qaeda enhanced domestic security six months attacks truly entering realm presidential choice indications that bush going use september 11th occasion launch new aggressive american foreign policy would represent broad change in direction rather specific war terrorism rhetoric especially two addresses given joint sessions congress since september 11th information state mind which his aides leaked indicate sees nation moment of destiny perception people around seem encouraging because enhances bush stature opens way assertive policymaking inside government reason september 11th appears transformative moment senior official lunch put is not much revealed existence threat officials had previously unaware drastically reduced american public usual resistance american military involvement overseas at least clinton administration beginning black hawk operation mogadishu first year operated the conviction americans highly averse casualties all bombing kosovo operation clinton next to last year ideal foreign military adventure united states attacked the options much broader senior official approvingly mentioned 1999 study casualty aversion triangle institute security studies which argued mass public much less casualty averse the military civilian lite believes example study showed that the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths military operation to prevent iraq acquiring weapons mass destruction american death total vietnam war fifty eight thousand september 11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further recently went white house interview condoleezza rice rice foreign affairs article 2000 begins declaration united states found exceedingly difficult define national interest in absence soviet power asked whether still the case think

terrorism talked west wing office tall windows face the part white house grounds television reporters their standups bearing rice seemed less crisply military does in public looked little tired projecting kind of missionary calm rather belligerence in foreign affairs article rice came across classic realist putting forth notions power politics great powers power balances proper central concerns united states she sounded moved closer one power idea cheney pentagon team proposed ten years ago or least idea the other great powers harmony united states of the terrorist attacks induced remain theoretically the realists would predict great power like united states would long great powers rising to challenge trying balance rice said think what you re seeing least predilection time move to productive coperative relations united states rather to try balance united states actually think statecraft matters in comes foreordained rice said called together senior staff people the national security council asked think seriously do you capitalize opportunities fundamentally change american doctrine shape world wake september 11th i really think period analogous 1945 1947 said that the period containment doctrine took shape events so clearly demonstrated big global threat big global threat lot countries would normally thought coalition started shifting the tectonic plates international politics important try to seize position american interests institutions of that harden the national security council legally required produce annual document called national security strategy stating over all goals of american policy another government report whose importance great but not obvious bush administration produce one last year the clinton administration first year rice said is working report now two ways handle document told one it in kind minimalist way get view since going first one bush administration it important awful lot happened since started process prior to 11 ca t give certain date going i would think sometime spring important real statement bush administration sees strategic direction that going it seems clear already rice set forth hope dominant

haass argued united states becoming less dominant world not more suggested revival might called traditional great power politics wolfowitz got higher ranking job haass deputy secretary of defense haass director policy planning state department in effect colin powell big think guy recently went see his office state department wall waiting room an array photographs every past director policy

mentioned title book using word reluctant reflective period foreign policy seemed secondary sacrificing foreign policy hard case to make said written bill clinton saying it the economy stupid not it world stupid two things very different one president much easier time making case that foreign policy matters second top national security charts notion weapons mass destruction terrorism asked haass

793,wanted get back t time actually lived on couple different indian reservations growing pacific northwest and also spent fair amount time lakota sioux country well my parents lived even diverse range indian reservations than experience direct result living parents do get lot information first hand cases second hand from father the income figures indians somewhat misleading mostly because it really hard proper accounting effective income it is true indians live genuine poverty typically consequence previous poor decisions made tribe not something impressed upon them the primary problem accounting tribal entity that exists separately individuals typically indian corporation one type another member tribe owns single share details share becomes active varies from tribe tribe tribes dividend paid the tribal members corporation usually tune 10 30k per person depending tribe dividend money comes number of places primary sources federal gov various businesses assets owned indian corporation you understand couple things first great many indian tribes are run purely communist enterprises everyone gets check their share matter one biggest problems caused very high unemployment often 70 90 tribal members happy take dividend work dividend receive the corporation often constitutes sole income government accounting purposes unfortunately support type economics one works ve sell useful assets maintain those dividends many tribes genuinely living poverty because they run things sell yet nobody works one ironies is that many reservations tribes still assets burn many people working stores actually poor white folk indians second even though tribe members get cash dividend also receive enormous range benefits perks indian corporation to tune tens thousands dollars per person annually by benefits perks talking kinds things other ordinary american receives either employer government it pointed many indian corporations are ineptly run mostly provide sinecures indians minority are very smartly managed hire non indian business executives good credentials run business divisions example the haida corporation less 000 tribal shareholders has billions dollars assets various corporations have gross revenues 200 300 million range growing yet the dividend paid strictly controlled 20k particular case engaged practice waiting couple decades before drawing money assets granted led to intelligent investment use n eat seed corn have actually managed grow stash contrast couple islands there another tribe 000 people net loss 50 million annually iirc regularly endowed federal government several billions dollars valuable assets this particular tribe modest income theory actual expenditures per person annually hundreds thousands dollars many borrow money future income incidentally particular case the people working frequently pull hundred thousand dollars year much goes back tribal corporation rather than pockets somewhat annoying federal government semi regularly grants valuable assets tribes ve burned ones previously given where feasible typically selling assets american foreign companies cycle continues so primary problem tribes problems a nutshell thoroughly pathological culture society few women reach age 16 without getting pregnant incest rape and gross promiscuity rampant inbreeding heavy drug abuse during pregnancy environmental factors created tribes very substantial fraction tribe literally mentally retarded many of the thoughtful intelligent tribe members leave reservation the earliest opportunity mostly avoid problems mentioned one reservation parents lived hiv infection rate 70 many of these societies thoroughly corrupt administration law is arbitrary capricious judges courts police etc in short many tribes still hanging together shambles become pathological societies have ever seen anywhere legal status really aren that many consequences behavior many things could tell ve seen probably would believe unless you seen always good people tribes but it gotten point losers idiots outnumber good guys fair margin many times mobocracy typically btw if white folk wants experience overt aggressive racism as minority place rule law fiction police are openly thugs try living one messed indian reservations it will give interesting perspective things there two real situations find reasonably prosperous indians first rare case tribes run disciplined and intelligent people managed assets wisely second is where tribe dispersed assimilated part even if they maintain tribal identity cases tribal leaders reject insular behavior tends lead pathological cases mentioned above the indians often quite wealthy technically lot money spent by tribe per capita actual reportable income quite high when consider many living entirely tribal dole is just peculiar economic structure lend well to ordinary economic analysis merely looking nominal income the poverty social cultural nature economic my original point on tangent one thing always interested concept quasi tribal corporate socialism many indian tribes implement type corporate socialism mind bogglingly bad execution use this structure accident history anything has interested smartly managed ones surprisingly well over long run like family corporation writ large it seems future familial ties increasingly voluntary general concept may merit general western

although many differences bridges programming languages find many ideas insights transfer rather directly according billington three values common many technological activities call the three efficiency economy elegance values correspond three dimensions technology which billington calls scientific social symbolic dimensions three consider in turn efficiency seeks minimize resources used in structural engineering efficiency deals amount material used basic criterion safety and the issues scientific strength materials disposition forces etc similarly programming language design efficiency scientific question dealing use resources many examples where efficiency considerations influenced programming language design reviewed principles programming languages early days resources minimized often runtime memory usage processing time although compile time resource utilization also relevant cases resource economized was programmer typing time well known cases compromised safety e fortran implicit declarations also many well known cases security i safety sacrificed for the sake efficiency neglecting runtime error checking e array bounds checking efficiency issues often

good design elegance cares elegance snorts hard nosed engineer billington shows clearly the critical role elegance hard nosed engineering for designer it well known feature interaction poses serious problem language designers the difficulty of analyzing possible interactions features language see principles examples structural engineers face similar problems analytic complexity billington observes best designers don make extensive use computer models calculation one reason mathematical analysis always incomplete engineer must make decision which variables significant analysis may lead incorrect conclusions this decision not made well also equations often simplified e made linear make analysis feasible this is another potential source error limitations engineers depend mathematical analysis may overdesign structure compensate unforeseen effects left analysis thus price of safety is additional material increased cost i decreased efficiency economy similarly programming language design limitations analytic approach often force us make choice under engineered design run risk unanticipated interactions an over engineered design confidence inefficient uneconomical many people seen famous film collapse 1940 four month old tacoma narrows bridge it vibrated pieces storm aerodynamical stability considered design billington explains accident along number less dramatic bridge failures a consequence of an increasing use theoretical analyses began 1920s however problem destroyed the tacoma narrows bridge anticipated avoided century bridge designers guided by aesthetic principles according billington best structural engineers rely mathematical analysis although do not abandon altogether rather design activity guided sense elegance because solutions to structural engineering problems usually greatly underdetermined many possible solutions particular problem bridging particular river therefore expert designers restrict attention to designs interaction forces easy see design looks unbalanced forces are unbalanced design looks stable stable the general principle designs look good also good therefore design process can be guided aesthetics without extensive incomplete mathematical analysis billington expresses idea by inverting old architectural maxim asserting structural design function follows form adds 21 form well chosen analysis becomes astoundingly simple words choice of form open free pick forms elegant design expresses good design i efficient and economical design let aesthetics guide design the applies programming language design restricting
